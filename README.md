# Hospital-Management-system

This repository houses my second-semester project: a Hospital Management System built using **C++, .NET Framework, and Windoforms**. This project utilizes **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts** to create a secure and efficient system for managing hospital operations.

**Key Features:**

* **Secure Login System:** Ensures authorized access for different user roles.
* **User-friendly Interfaces:** Separate interfaces for Patients, Receptionists, and Admins with dedicated functionalities.
* **Patient Management:**
    * Add, remove, update, and delete patient records.
    * Schedule, view, update, and delete appointments.
    * Manage prescriptions and generate reports.
    * View bills, reports, and appointments.
    * Provide feedback through the system.
* **Receptionist Management:**
    * Manage patient information (add, remove, update, delete).
    * Manage appointments (make, view, update, delete).
    * Advise and update prescriptions.
    * Generate patient reports.
* **Admin Management:**
    * View patient payments, inventory, and feedback.
    * Manage user accounts.
    * Generate system reports.

**Technology Stack:**

* **Programming Language:** C++
* **Framework:** .NET Framework
* **User Interface:** Windows Forms

* **File Handling:**
The project utilizes file handling techniques to store and retrieve patient records, appointments, prescriptions, and other relevant data, ensuring persistent storage and accessibility.



**Project Overview:**
The system operates on a secure login system, granting access to specific functionalities based on user roles. Each user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing seamless navigation and efficient task completion.

**This project demonstrates my understanding and application of OOP concepts in C++ and .NET Framework to develop a user-friendly and efficient hospital management system.**

**Feel free to explore the code and functionalities within the repository.**
